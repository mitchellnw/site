I am a PhD student at the University of Washington co-advised by
[Ali Farhadi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ali/) and
[Ludwig Schmidt](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ludwigs/).
I am interested in understanding and improving deep learning. My research so
far has studied [fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05482), 
[robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01903), neural network 
[sub](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.13299)-[networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14769), [subspaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10472).

Previously, I spent a great year as a member of the
[PRIOR Group](https://prior.allenai.org/) at the
[Allen Institute for AI (AI2)](https://allenai.org/)
under the supervision of [Roozbeh Mottaghi](https://cs.stanford.edu/~roozbeh/),
and as a research intern at Apple with 
[Mohammad Rastegari](https://allenai.org/team/mohammadr/).

I completed my undergraduate degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science
at Brown University in Providence, RI. For my [senior
honors thesis](/publications/#undergraduate-thesis) I was advised by [Kavita Ramanan](https://www.brown.edu/academics/applied-mathematics/kavita-ramanan).
During undergrad I completed internships at Facebook
(advised by [Yannis Kalantidis](http://www.skamalas.com/)) & Microsoft.

I am originally from Toronto, Canada and enjoy music,
skiing, hiking, camping, reading, traveling, and climbing.
