I am a PhD student at the University of Washington working with Professor
[Ali Farhadi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ali/).
I am interested in understanding and improving deep learning. My research so
far has studied neural network [sub](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.13299)-[networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14769), [subspaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10472), and [robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01903).

Previously, I spent a great year as a member of the
[PRIOR Group](https://prior.allenai.org/) at the
[Allen Institute for AI (AI2)](https://allenai.org/)
under the supervision of [Roozbeh Mottaghi](https://cs.stanford.edu/~roozbeh/).
At AI2 I have also received mentorship from
[Mohammad Rastegari](https://allenai.org/team/mohammadr/),
[Kiana Ehsani](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~kianae/) and
[Ali](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ali/).

I completed my undergraduate degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science
at Brown University in Providence, RI. For my [senior
honors thesis](/publications/#undergraduate-thesis) I was advised by [Kavita Ramanan](https://www.brown.edu/academics/applied-mathematics/kavita-ramanan).
During undergrad I completed internships at Facebook
(advised by [Yannis Kalantidis](http://www.skamalas.com/)) & Microsoft.

I am originally from Toronto, Canada and enjoy music,
skiing, hiking, camping, reading, traveling, and climbing.
